#### What was the gist? -> ⬇️
This was a project I co-founded with my mentor. We built a 2d rendering engine in rust to create
figma-like experience for people wanting to build maps for expositions + allow them to add a bunch of business logic on top.
Tough luck, we never got to finish it, but I learned a ton of stuff about rust and wasm along the way which was great!

#### What was the gist? -> ⬇️
This was my first job at a software agency and I learned a ton of stuff by contributing
to a wide range of projects as a full stack developer. Usually it was a team of 2-3 people working on
a mobile app + webapp + some sort of backend to support them. Later in the job I also got into
project management and lead a few
sprints for a team of 4 people. Also was a bit of a team scrum master.
