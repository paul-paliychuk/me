> The SOLID ideas are.

- The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility
- The Open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
